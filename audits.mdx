## Audit Overview

This report details the results of a static analysis conducted on the Paystream DeFi lending protocol using the tools **X-Ray (v0.0.6)** and **Radar**.  
Our audit spanned three primary program modules: `drift_optimizer`, `lib`, and `Paystream-v1`.  
The primary objective was to identify unsafe patterns, missing validations, and account mismanagement across Solana smart contracts that constitute the core protocol.

## Tooling & Methodology

- **Tools Used:** X-Ray v0.0.6, Radar  
- **Techniques:**  
  - IR file analysis  
  - Instruction graph traversal  
  - Owner/signer validation  
  - Unsafe `AccountInfo` pattern detection  
  - Collateral access audits  
- **Scope:** Drift Optimizer, Core Lending Program, Utility Libraries

## Findings

### Drift Optimizer

- **Vulnerability:** Missing `owner` check on `spot_market` account  
- **Location:** `get_apys.rs`, line 26  
- **Risk:** Unauthorized account manipulation; deserialization of arbitrary data  
- **Mitigation:** Add explicit owner validation matching expected protocol program

### Lib Module

- **Vulnerabilities:** None  
- **Status:** All logic modules and dependencies passed pointer and transformation analysis cleanly.

### Core Protocol (`Paystream-v1`)

- **Total Detected:** 33 vulnerabilities  
- **Patterns Observed:**  
  - Repeated absence of signer/owner checks on critical account inputs  
  - Unsafe use of unchecked `AccountInfo<'info>` under `CHECK:` macros  
  - Multiple validator bypass risks in borrow, repay, and withdraw flows  

#### High-Risk Locations

- `deposit.rs`: No signer validation on `protocol_vault_authority`  
- `lend.rs`: Improper validation of protocol and vault accounts  
- `borrow.rs`: Data leakage and injection risks due to unchecked accounts  
- `withdraw.rs`: Deserialization of `collateral_market` without secure constraints  
- `liquidate_by_ltv.rs`: Direct liquidatee access without auth constraints  

## Recommendations

1. Apply `.is_signer` and `.owner == expected_program_id` checks across all cross-program and `CHECK:` inputs  
2. Replace unchecked `AccountInfo` fields with validated `Account` or `InterfaceAccount` where feasible  
3. For all `#[account(...)]` constraints, enforce explicit runtime assertions  
4. Protect `dangerously_mutate_*` functions with hardcoded access lists or role-based checks

## Conclusion

While Paystream demonstrates significant innovation in on-chain lending and liquidity optimization, security hardening remains crucial before scaling further.  
Patching signer and owner validation gaps should be prioritized to mitigate protocol-level risks, particularly around token streaming and borrowing logic.  
A formal verification of economic invariants and runtime constraints is recommended before public audits.
