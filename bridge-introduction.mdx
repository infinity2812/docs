Paystream Bridge aggregator - Get the best rates for every cross-chain transfer, optimized for you.

This is Paystream's solution for moving assets across different blockchains in the cheapest, fastest, and most secure way possible. Instead of relying on a single bridge, Paystream Bridge works as a bridge aggregator it connects to multiple trusted bridges (starting with deBridge and Garden) and automatically compares them for you.

This means you don't need to spend time checking fees, speeds, or routes on different platforms. Paystream Bridge does the heavy lifting: it queries all integrated bridges in real time, evaluates their quotes, and selects the best route for your transfer. From your perspective, it feels like a single, smooth transaction but behind the scenes, Paystream Bridge ensures your funds are routed through the most cost-effective and reliable option.

In simple terms:

1. You choose the token, source chain, and destination chain.
2. Paystream Bridge checks all available bridges.
3. It finds the option that saves you the most money and time.
4. You confirm once, and Paystream Bridge handles the rest.

By introducing Paystream Bridge, we are solving one of the biggest pain points in DeFi: fragmented and expensive cross-chain transfers. With Paystream, bridging becomes as simple as making a single choice while the system ensures you always get the best deal.
