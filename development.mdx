Paystream also enables users to create payment agreements that distribute funds over time, based on pre-defined mathematical curves. TLDR- on-chain escrow contracts for freelancers, DAOs etc

**Stream Types**:

- **Linear**: Distributes payments at a steady rate over a set duration.
- **Cliff**: Starts payments after a predefined delay.
- **Step-Wise**: Releases payments at regular intervals, like weekly or monthly.
- **Custom curves** are also provided(0.5% fees as compared to standard 0.15%)

Here\`s a highly simplified flow of how payment streaming works-
