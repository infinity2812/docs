title: "What makes it different than other lending platforms?"
---

It would be easy to tackle this answer with a simple problem and solution method-

- **Problem**- On Kamino, APYs are influenced by **DEX trading fees** and **incentives**. The yields can fluctuate based on trading volume, price range, and rebalancing costs. Idle liquidity during periods of low trading activity leads to suboptimal returns for liquidity providers. **Solution**- PayStream introduces a **P2P matching layer** that directly connects borrowers and lenders to eliminate idle liquidity and reduce reliance on volatile APYs.
- **Problem**- Kamino’s lending mechanics are designed for liquidity providers, not for users needing customized repayment schedules. Borrowers must adhere to fixed terms, which can be rigid for freelancers, startups, or DAOs with milestone-based incomes. Solution- Borrowers repay loans using **payment streams**, aligning repayments with their cash flow.
- **Problem** – Over-collateralization leads to capital inefficiency.

  On platforms like Kamino and other PLFs, borrowers must lock up **significantly more collateral** than the loan they receive, often 150% or more. This capital inefficiency disincentivizes borrowing for many real-world users (like DAOs, freelancers, or founders) who can't afford to lock up idle capital just to access funds. **Solution** – PayStream reduces capital lock-up with **streaming repayment \+ re-use of locked collateral**

  PayStream enables borrowers to repay loans **gradually** through streaming, allowing for better liquidity management. Meanwhile, the **collateral they lock** is not idle — it is actively used to **fund other lending positions**, which **generates yield**. This unlocks value from locked collateral, effectively lowering the _real_ collateralization ratio and **improving capital efficiency**.
- **Problem**- On Kamino, liquidity providers face risks from **impermanent loss** and **out-of-range positions**, which impact yield stability. Solution- Liquidity providers on PayStream can earn both:
  - Trading fees and incentives from Kamino.
  - Interest from

  This diversification reduces reliance on volatile trading activity, not to mention PayStream integrates Kamino’s dynamic liquidation mechanisms with programmable repayment schedules, offering more borrower-friendly terms while protecting lender capital.

Paystream is not a competitor as it uses PLFs like Kamino under the hood, it simply provides a way of getting better rates while having the same guarantee, the same liquidity that you already get on other platforms.
