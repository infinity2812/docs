It would be easy to tackle this answer with a simple problem and solution method-

- **Problem** – On Kamino, lending returns are based on **utilization rates** and **interest rate curves**. When utilisation is low, a large portion of funds remain idle, leading to **low APYs for lenders**, while borrowers still pay high interest. This creates an **APY spread** where borrowers overpay and lenders under-earn.  
  **Solution** – Paystream introduces a **P2P matching layer** that directly connects borrowers and lenders at optimised rates, eliminating idle capital and minimising the spread between borrowing and lending rates.

- **Problem** – Kamino requires **funds to be locked for a fixed duration**, restricting lenders from accessing their capital when needed. This rigid structure doesn't suit users with dynamic needs, such as freelancers, DAOs, or startups.  
  **Solution** – In Paystream, **lenders can withdraw anytime**, even if their funds are currently borrowed, thanks to a dynamic liquidity system.

- **Problem** – On Kamino, collateral supplied by borrowers remains idle, leading to **capital inefficiency** despite being overcollateralized.  
  **Solution** – Paystream allows **borrowers to earn yield on their collateral** through **streaming modules**, turning locked assets into productive capital.


  On platforms like Kamino and other PLFs, borrowers must lock up **significantly more collateral** than the loan they receive, often 150% or more. This capital inefficiency disincentivises borrowing for many real-world users (like DAOs, freelancers, or founders) who can't afford to lock up idle capital just to access funds. **Solution** – Paystream reduces capital lock-up with **streaming repayment \+ re-use of locked collateral**

  Paystream enables borrowers to repay loans **gradually** through streaming, allowing for better liquidity management. Meanwhile, the **collateral they lock** is not idle; it is actively used to **fund other lending positions**, which **generates yield**. This unlocks value from locked collateral, effectively lowering the _real_ collateralization ratio and **improving capital efficiency**.
- **Problem**- On Kamino, liquidity providers face risks from **impermanent loss** and **out-of-range positions**, which impact yield stability. Solution- Liquidity providers on Paystream can earn both:
  - Trading fees and incentives from Kamino.
  - Interest from

  This diversification reduces reliance on volatile trading activity, not to mention Paystream integrates Kamino’s dynamic liquidation mechanisms with programmable repayment schedules, offering more borrower-friendly terms while protecting lender capital.

Paystream is not a competitor, as it uses PLFs like Kamino under the hood; it simply provides a way of getting better rates while having the same guarantee, the same liquidity that you already get on other platforms.
