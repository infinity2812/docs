### **1. Streaming Fee Structure**

PayStream charges fees for setting up and managing payment streams:

1. **Basic Streams**:
   - **Fee**: 0.15% of the total stream amount.
   - **Use Cases**: Simple, continuous payment streams (e.g., daily salary payments or freelancer payments).

   **Example**:
   - Total Stream Amount: \$1,000
   - Fee = <Latex>1,000 \times 0.0015 = \$1.50</Latex>
2. **Custom Streams**:
   - **Fee**: 0.5% of the total stream amount.
   - **Use Cases**: Advanced streams with programmable curves (e.g., milestone-based payments or non-linear repayment schedules).

   **Example**:
   - Total Stream Amount: \$2,000
   - Fee = 2,000×0.005=\$10.00

Note- Fee structutre still has to be decided upon, so don't consider it a hard-and-fast rule\!

### **2. Lending Fee Structure**

PayStream generates revenue by charging a spread on the interest rate between borrowers and lenders via its **P2P matching engine**.

1. **Borrower Interest Rate**:
   - Borrowers pay a fixed or dynamic interest rate (e.g., 5% APY).
2. **Lender Return**:
   - Lenders receive a slightly lower rate (e.g., 4% APY).
3. **Platform Spread**:
   - PayStream keeps the difference (1% APY in this example) as its revenue.

   **Example**:
   - Loan Amount: \$100,000
   - Borrower Rate: 5% APY = 5,000 annual interest.
   - Lender Rate: 4% APY = 4,000 annual return.
   - **Revenue** = Borrower Interest − Lender Return = 5,000−4,000=\$1,000.

### When will the protocol be sustainable?

So as of right now considering 4 months of testnet development and after that, we can start rolling out on the mainnet in multiple phases(closed alpha, closed beta, beta, Final launch) This is a theoretical overview of future expenses and revenue model(after final launch) which are completely predicted as of now-
