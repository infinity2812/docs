So PayStream has mainly two Services-

- Lending P2P engine
- Payment streaming

To gain user trust, we will start deploying payment streaming features first, as that is helpful for freelancers, startups, and DAOs as they transfer payments regularly on a timely basis. Then by partnering with multiple protocols like Superteam to become their official way of giving grants to their grantees, we can gain more trust, and for the first 25 protocols or firms, we will not be charging any fees (this is to gain market adoption and trust).

After this, we will deploy our lending market optimizer engine, which will use the gained user's trust to generate traffic over PayStream.

To make PayStream more scalable, we will be doing partnerships with DeFi aggregators like [earnpark.com](http://earnpark.com)[,](http://earnpark.com/) which uses markets like Kamino to generate the most profitable strategies.
