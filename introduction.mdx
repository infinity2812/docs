title: " What is Paystream?"
---
Paystream is a peer‑to‑peer lending protocol with its own leveraged engine on Solana that maximizes APYs by directly matching borrowers and lenders. Idle capital is routed to the LLP lending pool and fallback pools, ensuring zero idle capital and eliminating APY spread. The LLP pool amplifies returns on idle liquidity while preventing liquidity fragmentation. Leveraged Liquidity Provisioning in Paystream enables users to deploy funds into AMMs with leverage, unlocking amplified returns.

## leveraged liquidity provisioning 
LLP enables users to leverage their liquidity positions in DeFi pools by borrowing capital from Paystream’s leveraged lending pool. This allows them to scale positions beyond their initial capital and earn amplified yield.

Lenders benefit by earning higher returns on their supplied capital, creating a self‑sustaining capital flywheel.

The LLP lending pool also serves as a primary destination for idle liquidity, ensuring maximum yield and zero idle capital. Additionally, it consolidates liquidity, removing fragmentation across the protocol
## Fall back pools
In addition to LLP pools, Paystream provides protocol-based fallback where idle liquidity is deployed to traditional lending protocols like Kamino, etc.

## Bridge aggregator
Paystream includes a Bridge Aggregator that ensures users always receive the best available rates when moving assets across blockchains. Instead of relying on a single provider, the aggregator connects to multiple trusted cross-chain bridges such as deBridge and Garden, fetching live quotes and automatically routing transfers through the most cost-efficient path.

By integrating the Bridge Aggregator into Paystream, we extend our core principle — zero idle capital and maximum efficiency — beyond lending and liquidity provisioning into cross-chain asset transfers, giving users seamless access to the best rates across ecosystems.
