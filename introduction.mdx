title: " What is Paystream?"
---
Paystream is a peer‑to‑peer lending protocol with its own leveraged engine on Solana that maximizes APYs by directly matching borrowers and lenders. Idle capital is routed to the LLP lending pool and fallback pools, ensuring zero idle capital and eliminating APY spread. The LLP pool amplifies returns on idle liquidity while preventing liquidity fragmentation. Leveraged Liquidity Provisioning in Paystream enables users to deploy funds into AMMs with leverage, unlocking amplified returns.

## leveraged liquidity provisioning 
LLP enables users to leverage their liquidity positions in DeFi pools by borrowing capital from Paystream’s leveraged lending pool. This allows them to scale positions beyond their initial capital and earn amplified yield.

Lenders benefit by earning higher returns on their supplied capital, creating a self‑sustaining capital flywheel.

The LLP lending pool also serves as a primary destination for idle liquidity, ensuring maximum yield and zero idle capital. Additionally, it consolidates liquidity, removing fragmentation across the protocol
## Routing : zero idle liquidity
Paystream routes idle capital  to earn maximum yield. When funds are not actively matched in the P2P market, the routing engine automatically deploys them into the LLP lending pools and other high-performing protocols such as Kamino and similar platforms. Router re-routes capital continuously, ensuring maximum yield per dollar on idle liquidity.
