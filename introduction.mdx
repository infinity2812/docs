title: " What is Paystream?"
---
PayStream is a peer-to-peer DeFi lending platform that keeps capital productive. It matches lenders and borrowers directly, cutting APY spreads, while routing unmatched funds into Solana protocols like Kamino and Drift. Lenders earn more, borrowers pay less, and funds never sit idle. PayStream is the missing layer in DeFi lending, more yield, lower rates, no inefficiencies.
Visit [PayStream.finance](https://paystream.finance) to get started with our platform.

## Optimizers

Paystream provides protocol-based optimisers where users can choose what kind of optimiser they like to use as a fallback yield generator. Here we have MarginFi Optimiser.
