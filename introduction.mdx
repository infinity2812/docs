title: " What is Paystream?"
description: "
PayStream is a P2P lending layer that connects borrowers and lenders directly on top of existing DeFi lending protocols like Kamino and MarginFi. It optimizes APYs by matching capital in real time and allowing borrowers to repay loans via programmable payment streams. Unmatched capital is automatically routed to underlying protocols to earn yield, ensuring no idle liquidity."
