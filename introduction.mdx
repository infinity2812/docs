title: " What is Paystream?"
---
Paystream is a peer‑to‑peer lending protocol with its own leveraged engine on Solana that maximises APYs by directly matching borrowers and lenders. Idle capital is routed to the LLP lending pool and fallback pools, ensuring zero idle capital and eliminating APY spread. The LLP pool amplifies returns on idle liquidity while preventing liquidity fragmentation. Leveraged Liquidity Provisioning in Paystream enables users to deploy funds into AMMs with leverage, unlocking amplified returns

## leveraged liquidity provisionig 
LLP enables users to leverage their liquidity positions in DeFi pools by borrowing capital from Paystream’s leveraged lending pool. This allows them to scale positions beyond their initial capital and earn amplified yield.

Lenders benefit by earning higher returns on their supplied capital, creating a self‑sustaining capital flywheel.

The LLP lending pool also serves as a primary destination for idle liquidity, ensuring maximum yield and zero idle capital. Additionally, it consolidates liquidity, removing fragmentation across the protocol
## Fall back pools
In addition to llp pools paystream provides protocol-based fall back where idle liquidity is deployed to a traditional lending protocols like kamino etc .
