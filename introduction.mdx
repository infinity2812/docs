---
Paystream is a peer‑to‑peer lending protocol with its own leveraged engine on Solana that maximises APYs by directly matching borrowers and lenders. Idle capital is routed to the LLP lending pool and fallback pools, ensuring zero idle capital and eliminating APY spread. The LLP pool amplifies returns on idle liquidity while preventing liquidity fragmentation. Leveraged Liquidity Provisioning in Paystream enables users to deploy funds into AMMs with leverage, unlocking amplified returns
