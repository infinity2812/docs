## PayStream also includes a lending system that combines:

- **P2P Matching**: Directly connects borrowers and lenders to optimize rates.
- **Fallback to Liquidity Pools**: Uses platforms like Kamino for unmatched requests to maintain liquidity and rewards for the lenders.
- **Stream-Based Repayments**: Borrowers repay loans over time through customizable payment streams, allowing flexibility and no need of overcollateralized loans
- User will put collateral in stablecoin only that will go to the underlying protocol and will generate a supply rate based yield
- User will pay the interest fee either in advance or along the repayment periods Note - if any time the user misses the repayment collateral will be reduced to ensure the protocol doesn't go into bad debt

> stablecoin backed on-chain contracts.
