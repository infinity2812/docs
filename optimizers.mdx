title: "Fallback Pools"
description: "Router deploys the capital to the integrated pools"

In Paystream, capital is never left idle. When a lenderâ€™s funds are not immediately matched with a borrower in the P2P market, they are automatically deployed to the LLP lending pool and diversified fallback pools. This ensures that the capital continues to generate yield at all times.

The LLP lending pool serves as the primary yield engine, designed to deliver the highest returns in the Solana lending ecosystem by deploying liquidity into leveraged positions within liquidity pools. Meanwhile, fallback pools act as secondary destinations, providing yields on temporarily idle liquidity. Together, this structure eliminates idle capital, maintains continuous utilization, and maximizes APY for lenders.

This dynamic routing enables lenders to enjoy consistent returns, allows LP users to access leveraged capital efficiently, and keeps the entire system running as a self-sustaining capital flywheel with zero idle capital.

We plan to integrate only the most high-performing and secure third-party lending protocols as fallback destinations, including Kamino, MarginFi (Project 0), Drift, and Jupiter Lend.
