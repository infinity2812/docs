![Optimizers Workflow](./images/optimizers-workflow.png)


In Paystream, an **optimizer** is a strategy layer that determines where unmatched funds are deposited to earn passive yield when there’s no active P2P match. Optimizers are directly tied to the **underlying protocols** they integrate with  meaning each optimizer routes idle liquidity to a specific DeFi protocol where it can generate fallback interest until matched with a borrower.

We're building a range of optimizers based on top Solana protocols. These include:

- **Drift Optimizer** *(live now)*
- **Kamino Optimizer** *(coming soon)*
- **MarginFi Optimizer** *(coming soon)*
- **Save Finance Optimizer** *(coming soon)*

When a user supplies funds into Paystream, they’ll be able to choose which optimizer to use. If their capital is not instantly matched via P2P, the funds are automatically deposited into the selected protocol, earning yield while waiting to be matched.

Alongside optimizers, Paystream organizes liquidity using **markets**, each associated with a specific token (e.g., USDC, SOL, JITO) and a specific optimizer. That means we don’t just have “a USDC market”  we may have multiple USDC markets, each tied to a different optimizer like Kamino or Drift.

Once a market becomes full  meaning it reaches a preset cap on the number of lenders and borrowers  Paystream will automatically **spin up a new market** for the same token and optimizer.
