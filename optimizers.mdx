In Paystream, an **optimiser** is a strategy layer that determines where unmatched funds are deposited to earn passive yield when there’s no active P2P match. Optimisers are directly tied to the **underlying protocols** they integrate with, meaning each optimiser routes idle liquidity to a specific DeFi protocol where it can generate fallback interest until matched with a borrower.

We’re building a suite of optimisers on top of leading Solana protocols, including Drift, Kamino, MarginFi and Save Finance, with Drift currently live.

When a user supplies funds into Paystream, they’ll be able to choose which optimiser to use. If their capital is not instantly matched via P2P, the funds are automatically deposited into the selected protocol, earning yield while waiting to be matched.

Alongside optimisers, Paystream organises liquidity using **markets**, each associated with a specific token (e.g., USDC, SOL, JITO) and a specific optimiser. That means we don’t just have “a USDC market”, we may have multiple USDC markets, each tied to a different optimiser like Kamino or Drift.

Once a market becomes full, meaning it reaches a preset cap on the number of lenders and borrowers, Paystream will automatically **spin up a new market** for the same token and optimiser.
