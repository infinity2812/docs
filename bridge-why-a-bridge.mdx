Blockchains are isolated execution environments: tokens and state on Chain A are not usable on Chain B without an inter-chain primitive. Bridges implement that primitive via patterns such as lock-mint, burn-mint, relayer/forwarder, and optimistic- or bond-based settlement. Bridges provide the minimal guarantees required for cross-chain value transfer (finality assumptions, canonical proofs, or relayer incentives), but each bridge differs in: settlement model, supported token formats, liquidity model, fee structure, and latency profile. Because these differences affect final received amount and execution risk, bridges are required infrastructure but are not interchangeable at the protocol level.

## Why a bridge aggregator  

A single-bridge strategy locks users into one provider’s fees, liquidity, and latency. An aggregator removes this dependency through parallel discovery, querying multiple providers at once and normalizing quotes. Instead of headline fees, it compares total cost — provider_fee + gas + slippage — on a common base. The system will also supports composite routing, combining multi-hop paths when they yield better output, and order-splitting, distributing large transfers across providers to reduce slippage. Hard filtering excludes routes that fail security or liquidity checks. The result is a competitive marketplace where users consistently get the lowest net cost for their transfers.
## Why Paystream — how we minimize total user cost

**Key benefits:**

* **Best Rates:** Always routes to the lowest total cost (fees + gas + slippage).
* **Non-Custodial & Safe:** You stay in control, Paystream only coordinates.
* **Future-Proof:** Privacy-preserving routes and new providers are coming soon.

Paystream minimizes costs through a deterministic routing pipeline. Each provider integrates via a thin adapter that normalizes quotes, allowing direct comparison across bridges like deBridge, Garden, and aggregators such as LI.FI, Rango, and Rubic.

Routing is cost-first: every path is scored on total outlay (fees + gas + slippage), with latency and risk considered but secondary. The system evaluates direct, multi-hop, and split routes to reduce slippage and maximize received value.

Before execution, quotes are revalidated or locked; if terms move beyond your slippage tolerance, the transfer is safely stopped and updated options are shown. Execution is fully non-custodial — you sign transactions, Paystream only coordinates.

Safeguards include idempotent request IDs, provider vetting, and continuous monitoring of savings, failures, and latency. Transient issues retry automatically; persistent ones trigger failover to the next-best route or return a clear error.

Looking ahead, Paystream will integrate privacy-focused protocols (e.g., RAILGUN, Aztec) as optional adapters, so users can choose routes that protect both value and privacy without losing optimization.
