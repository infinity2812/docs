### Lenders


Lenders deposit funds into the lending pool, which operates with a maximum utilization ratio (M%) to maintain the overall health of the system and ensure sufficient fund availability. Interest is earned by lenders based on the amount they lend and the utilization level of the pool. The interest paid by borrowers is distributed proportionally among all lenders according to their share in the pool. Interest accrual occurs on a per-block basis, enabling real-time earning and transparency.

### LP users / Borrowers

Investors on Paystream can choose to invest using their own capital or amplify their positions by leveraging funds from the lending pool. Each investor assumes the risk of liquidation based on their Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. Investments can be made in DLMM or DAMM V2 pools, either manually by selecting a specific pool or automatically by copying trades from a chosen wallet. In auto-trading mode, all positions made by the selected wallet are mirrored, with the option to set a maximum leverage cap for added control. Before any investment, the user’s deposited SOL is automatically swapped into the relevant tokens required by the chosen pool.

### **Rebalancing (Optional)**

- Users can opt in for **rebalancing**, which manages the token ratios during a position.
- It ensures positions stay within the optimal range, reducing the risk of impermanent loss or liquidation.
- Rebalancing fees apply.

### **Liquidation Mechanism**

The liquidation mechanism  applies only when leverage is taken and serves as a core component of the protocol’s risk management system. It is triggered when an investor’s Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio exceeds a predefined threshold, signaling increased risk. To protect lender capital and maintain system stability, the protocol supports partial liquidation to recover funds and full liquidation if the risk persists. Additionally, deleveraging actions may be taken based on overall pool utilization. Investors have the option to deposit more funds into their position to boost their margin and avoid liquidation.

### **Fees**

- **Lenders**, **borrowers**, and **investors** are subject to specific fees based on their roles and actions (e.g., rebalancing).
- A **refundable Solana rent fee** is required to open a position on Meteora (~0.05 SOL) and keep the lending/borrowing account.
- A **minimum of 0.2 SOL** is recommended to ensure sufficient balance for operations.
