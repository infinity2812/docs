# Leveraged Lending Pool

A **shared liquidity system** with the following components:

![lending-pool](./images/lending-pool.png)

---

## 1. Lenders

- Deposit a base asset (e.g., **SOL**, **USDC**)
- Receive interest over time

## 2. Borrowers

- Access funds to enter leveraged LP positions

## 3. Interest Accrual on Borrowed Capital

- **Borrow rate depends on**
    - *Types of pools and leverage levels (maximum of the category)*
        - **12 %** for 1 **– 1.5 ×** leverage
        - **15 %** for **1.5– 2×** leverage
        - **17 %** for **2 – 3×** leverage
    - utilization rate
    
    the borrow rate is variable at every utilization point 
    
## 4. Global Liquidity Index (GLI)

- Maintained for both **lenders** and **borrowers**
- Increases with each borrower-interest event
- Used to calculate lender yield on exit

> Note  Because there are three borrowing-rate tiers (by leverage), we maintain three global indices on the borrowing side.

## Global Liquidity Index Explained

The **GLI** tracks cumulative yield earned by the lending pool over time. Each time a borrower accrues interest, the GLI updates to reflect that yield.

Whenever a lender deposits or a borrower takes a loan, we record the current index value as a **snapshot**:

- For **lenders**: store `GLI_entry` at the time of deposit
- For **borrowers**: store `BLI_entry` based on their **leverage tier**

When they later withdraw or repay, we compare the current index to the snapshot to determine how much interest they have earned or owe.

```
lenderBalance = deposit × (GLI_now / GLI_entry)
```

---

## Total Borrow-Rate Formula

```
totalBorrowRate = (B1 × U1 + B2 × U2 + B3 × U3) / totalUtilization
```

**Where**

- `B1`, `B2`, `B3` = Borrow rates for leverage levels different category
- `U1`, `U2`, `U3` = Utilization (borrowed amount / total available) for each borrower type
- `totalUtilization = U1 + U2 + U3`

```
liquidityRate = totalborrowRate x totalUtilization x  (1 - riskFactor)
```

---

### Liquidity-Index Update Formulas

### For Lenders

```
GLI(t) = GLI(t-1) × (1 + liquidityRate × Δt)
```

### For Borrowers

```
BLI(t) = BLI(t-1) × (1 + borrowRate × Δt)
```

> Note  1 + rate × Δt is the compound-interest factor.
> 
> For **simple interest**, replace it with `borrowRate × Δt`.
> 
> Note - for each category a different index is calculated

## Borrow Liquidity Indexes (BLI)  Three Risk Tiers

Each leverage / risk bucket compounds independently.

| Tier | Typical LTV / leverage | Symbol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ≤ 1 × (safe) | `BLI₁` |
| 2 | ≤ 2 × (medium) | `BLI₂` |
| 3 | ≤ 3 × (high) | `BLI₃` |

### Per‑Tier Update Rule

$$
\text{bli}_{k,t} = \text{bli}_{k,t-1} \times \left(1 + \text{borrowRate}_k \times \Delta t \right)
$$

**Repayment formula**

```
interest = principal * (BLI_now_k / BLI_entry_k - 1)
```

Note - snapshot is taken every time the borrower takes a leverage / loan for the respective borrowed amount 
-Both *GLI* (for lenders) and *BLI₁ / BLI₂ / BLI₃* (for borrowers) are updated at regular intervals, ideally per block.
