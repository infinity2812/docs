A **shared liquidity system** with the following components:

## 1. Lenders

Lenders deposit a base asset (e.g., SOL, USDC) into the Paystream lending pool. In return, they earn interest over time based on the pool’s utilization and borrowing demand. Their funds help power leveraged trading opportunities for other users. The protocol ensures lender capital remains liquid, allowing for instant withdrawals at any time. Interest is distributed proportionally based on each lender’s share in the pool, and accrual occurs per block.

## 2. Borrowers

Borrowers access capital from the lending pool to enter leveraged LP (Liquidity Provider) positions in supported pools like DLMM or DAMM V2. They can choose to invest manually or use auto-trading by copying another wallet's strategy. Borrowers are required to maintain a healthy Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to avoid liquidation. Before entering a position, their deposited SOL is automatically converted into the appropriate tokens for the chosen pool.

## 3. Interest Accrual on Borrowed Capital

- **Borrow rate depends on**
    - *Types of pools and leverage levels (maximum of the category)*
        - **12 %** for 1 **– 1.5 ×** leverage
        - **15 %** for **1.5– 2×** leverage
        - **17 %** for **2 – 3×** leverage
    - utilization rate
    
    the borrow rate is variable at every utilization point 
    
## 4. Global Liquidity Index (GLI)

- Maintained for both **lenders** and **borrowers**
- Increases with each borrower-interest event
- Used to calculate lender yield on exit

> Note  Because there are three borrowing-rate tiers (by leverage), we maintain three global indices on the borrowing side.

## Global Liquidity Index Explained

The **GLI** tracks cumulative yield earned by the lending pool over time. Each time a borrower accrues interest, the GLI updates to reflect that yield.

Whenever a lender deposits or a borrower takes a loan, we record the current index value as a **snapshot**:

- For **lenders**: store `GLI_entry` at the time of deposit
- For **borrowers**: store `BLI_entry` based on their **leverage tier**

When they later withdraw or repay, we compare the current index to the snapshot to determine how much interest they have earned or owe.

```
lenderBalance = deposit × (GLI_now / GLI_entry)
```

---

## Total Borrow-Rate Formula

```
totalBorrowRate = (B1 × U1 + B2 × U2 + B3 × U3) / totalUtilization
```

**Where**

- `B1`, `B2`, `B3` = Borrow rates for leverage levels different category
- `U1`, `U2`, `U3` = Utilization (borrowed amount / total available) for each borrower type
- `totalUtilization = U1 + U2 + U3`

```
liquidityRate = totalborrowRate x totalUtilization x  (1 - riskFactor)
```

---

### Liquidity-Index Update Formulas

### For Lenders

```
GLI(t) = GLI(t-1) × (1 + liquidityRate × Δt)
```

### For Borrowers

```
BLI(t) = BLI(t-1) × (1 + borrowRate × Δt)
```

> Note  1 + rate × Δt is the compound-interest factor.
> 
> For **simple interest**, replace it with `borrowRate × Δt`.
> 
> Note - for each category a different index is calculated

## Borrow Liquidity Indexes (BLI)  Three Risk Tiers

Each leverage / risk bucket compounds independently.

| Tier | Typical LTV / leverage | Symbol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ≤ 1 × (safe) | `BLI₁` |
| 2 | ≤ 2 × (medium) | `BLI₂` |
| 3 | ≤ 3 × (high) | `BLI₃` |

### Per‑Tier Update Rule

$$
\text{bli}_{k,t} = \text{bli}_{k,t-1} \times \left(1 + \text{borrowRate}_k \times \Delta t \right)
$$

**Repayment formula**

```
interest = principal * (BLI_now_k / BLI_entry_k - 1)
```

Note - snapshot is taken every time the borrower takes a leverage / loan for the respective borrowed amount 
-Both *GLI* (for lenders) and *BLI₁ / BLI₂ / BLI₃* (for borrowers) are updated at regular intervals, ideally per block.
