title: "Liquidation (LLP)"
description: ""
---
This mechanism safeguards both the **lenders’ funds** and the **integrity of the protocol**.

The purpose of liquidation is to ensure that the protocol can recover the full value of the borrowed principal token, so that lenders are returned the exact amount of the principal they deposited.

Therefore, the **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** calculation is done entirely in terms of the **principal token** (or usd )  for both the **borrowed amount** and the **current value of the position**.

Borrowers can avoid liquidation by **increasing their margin**, either:

- **Manually**, by adding more funds to the position, or
- **Automatically**, by enabling **auto-mode**, provided their wallet maintains sufficient balance. (in future)

## **LTV (Loan-to-Value) & Liquidation Logic**

**LTV (Loan-to-Value)** measures how much the borrower has borrowed compared to the current value of their position (LP + collateral).

- **Formula**:
    
    `LTV = Debt / Position Value`
    
    ```markdown
    Debt = principal × (BLI_now / BLI_entry)
    
    note - everywhere debt is constantly increasing using 
    this formula
    ```
    
- If the LTV gets too high (e.g., 85–90%), it means the borrower's position is no longer safely over-collateralized and is at risk.

## Partial Liquidation Logic (Individual Risk Control)

Partial liquidation is designed as a **borrower-friendly safeguard and a way to safeguard lenders fund from being completely lost** , offering a chance to stabilize their position **before full liquidation** is triggered  especially during volatile market conditions.

- **Trigger**: When an individual borrower's **LTV** crosses the **partial threshold** (e.g., 85%).
- **Action**: A calculated portion of their LP position is closed. The resulting assets are used to repay part of the debt.
- **Goal**: Bring the LTV back to a safer range (e.g., down to 75%) **without liquidating the entire position**.
- **Why**: This protects **lender funds** while giving borrowers a **fairer chance** to recover compared to immediate full liquidation.

### One-Time Liquidation Logic

- **Partial liquidation** is triggered **once** per liquidation cycle.
- If the borrower **adds more funds** and LTV drops below the **safe threshold**, they become eligible for **partial liquidation again** in the future.
- For now, **partial liquidation is only applied to blue-chip and mid-cap assets**

### Precision-Based Recovery (Not Fixed Slice)

Unlike protocols that liquidate a **fixed slice** (e.g., 50%), our system calculates the exact value needed to **recover 80% of the lender’s principal**, based on:

- The **borrower’s leverage**
- Current **LTV**
- Position size and debt

Position to liquidate = 0.8 x borrowed amount

*Note: `borrowed amount = debt` in calculations.*

### State-Based Model (Simple Logic)

For each position, track a flag: `has_been_partially_liquidated`.

**Initial State:**

- `has_been_partially_liquidated = false`

### Example Scenario

Let’s say:

- `partial_threshold = 80 %`
- `full_threshold = 90 %`
- `safe_threshold = 70 %`

1. Borrower LTV hits 80 %
    - Partial liquidation triggers, flag is set.
2. Borrower does **nothing**, LTV reaches 91 %
    - Full liquidation triggers.
3. If after partial liquidation borrower adds more collateral, LTV drops to 65 %
    - System resets the flag; they get another shot.

### Trigger Rules

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `LTV ≥ partial_threshold` **and** `has_been_partially_liquidated = false` | → Do **partial liquidation** (e.g. 50 %), then set `has_been_partially_liquidated = true` |
| `LTV ≥ full_threshold` **and** `has_been_partially_liquidated = true` | → **Fully liquidate** the remaining position |
| `LTV < safe_threshold` (e.g. user tops up collateral) | → Reset `has_been_partially_liquidated = false` |
|  |  |

##  **Deleveraging (System-Wide Risk Control)**

![develarage Workflow](./images/Deleverage-workflow.png)
we deleverage that is reduce the levergae (lenders fund that the borrower have borrowed)

- **Trigger**: Utilization of the lending pool exceeds a critical limit (e.g., 95%) and lenders may not be able to withdraw.
- **Action**: A portion of **all borrower positions** are liquidated proportionally, e.g., user 1 has $200 borrowed, user 2 $50 → both repay 10% of their debt.
- **Why**: Ensures the protocol maintains enough liquidity to satisfy lender withdrawals.



### Calculate total debt to repay

**ΔB = totalBorrowed − (U_target × totalDeposits)**

ΔB = B − U_target · D

**amount to liquidate** 

For every borrower `i` with current debt `Debtᵢ`:

```
liquidateᵢ = Debtᵢ × (ΔB / B)
```

- Every borrower repays **the same percentage** of their outstanding debt:
    
    `percentage_to_repay = ΔB / B`
    
- After liquidation each borrower’s new debt is
    
    `Debtᵢ_new = Debtᵢ − liquidateᵢ`
